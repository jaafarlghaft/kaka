                     <p>Ouarzazate in Morocco is around 200 kilometers south of Marrakech and is a popular stopover for round trips, but also for excursions and desert tours. The city itself is worth seeing, but the immediate area also has some great attractions to offer. Ouarzazate is best known for its film studios in which world-famous films were made, and for the Kasbah Taourirt, which is well-preserved and can be viewed from the inside. However, one of the best things to do in Ouarzazate is a visit to the clay town of Ait-Ben-Haddou, which is not far from Ouarzazate.</p>

      <div>
      <p>The fortress of the former Glawi Pasha is built against the old houses of the medina, where was the small village of Ouarzazate before the French troops’ arrival. The casbah has been partially renovated thanks to UNESCO help and funds, and can be visited every day (with or without a guide).</p>                  
      <p>In the entrance yard, you can see the famous Krupp cannon that was given to the Glawi family, and marks the beginning of their ascent. The favourite’s apartment, the hammam (steam bath) and the large reception lounges display the remnants of the impressive wealth of the Glawis.</p>

      <div>
      <p>Just in front of the casbah, a museum of “film making in Ouarzazate” was created in the former Andromeda studios (This Italian production company still operates other studios outside of Ouarzazate). One can see large sets (partially re-created), and especially the ones built for a serial of biblical films that were made over a period of ten years.</p>                  
      <p>It is a funny experience to reach in five steps only the munificent palace of Ponce Pilate after leaving the cells of Roman circus. Many other sets are shown, and a very large room displays machines and cameras, showing a summary of film making history since the very beginnings.</p>
